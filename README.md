# e-Receipt
e-Receipt, one Windows Form application for automating the process of daily tasks between a seller, suppliers, and clients! 
To the seller, it has to do with registering, viewing, and accounting for profits above the sold(or investment) products! On another side, for the client, itâ€™s an assistant with the receipt/invoice for purchased products he had in real time using RLDC reporting!
